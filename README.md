common_consts
===

Constants used in daily life.

*The author of this crate is not good at English.*  
*Forgive me if the document is hard to read.*

Words that express quantities in daily conversations are often used in
source code as well. Since it is tedious to define constants for those
magic numbers in each project, we collect them here.

## Values

Quantity values (In `qv` module).

* `ZERO`
* `FEW`
* `SOME`
* `SEVERAL`
* `HANDFUL`
* `MANY`

Frequency values (In `fv` module).

* `NEVER`
* `ALMOST_NEVER`
* `RARELY`
* `OCCASIONALLY`
* `SOMETIMES`
* `OFTEN`
* `ALMOST`
* `ALWAYS`

## Notes

Specific values for each constants may change in future versions.
